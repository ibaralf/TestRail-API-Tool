# TestRail-API-Tool

TestRail (http://www.gurock.com/testrail/) is one of the best test case management software available. It has available APIs which can be used to mark your automated test results.

This is a command line tool that parses through all your RSPEC XML results file or Squish results file and marks all the test cases (Passed, Failed, ...) via API calls.
